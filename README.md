**Calculator**

This project consists of the development of a simple calculator using HTML/CSS and Javascript.

**Description**

- EventListeners on the buttons of the calculator and on each keydown event on the keyboard registers the numbers and operations demanded by the user.
- The textContent on the screen changes based on what the user has inputted.
- When a second operator or a valid equation followed by an equals request is made, the program slices the textContent into two numbers, one before the operator and one after.
- It then conducts the operation based on the operator that it has found and changes the textContent to display the result.

**Built with**
- HTML for the basic structure.
- Javascript for DOM creation and the logic of the calculator.
- CSS for styling and usability.

**To improve**
- There was a bug that I could not recreate and identify where upon equals, it simply added the second number to the first like a string. Testing is still needed.
- Improving UI.
- Re-reading code, and seeing if any simplifications can be made.
